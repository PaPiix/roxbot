## Todo List
A list I just dump ideas on or planned bug fixes so that I can keep track.

#### High Priority
- ~~Create print settings command~~

#### Mid Priority
- Make the code cleaner so that it isn't eye cancer
- Move away from using ID's for everything. Maybe replace list with dict
- On member role assign, welcome member using on_member_update
- Add check for no channel id when a module is enabled

#### Low Priority
- Improve user experience
- Better help menu- AutoGen using command.help
- Document admin commands so that all commands are documented
- Constant file for constants

#### Command Ideas
- Overwatch stats - Using Overwatch-API lib
- Info command that shows info of bot incl. python metadata
- Command to print readme.md
- Admin tools - For commands already in and things like purge a chat
